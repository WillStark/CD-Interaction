        <h2>Satellite</h2>
        <h3 class="attribution">by Dustin Bates</h3>
        <p>
          My satellite<br>
          Are you here tonight?<br>
          Shine your light and set me free<br>
          Take the darkness out of me<br>
          Shine on me<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Far across the emptiness I walk the night<br>
          And search the silence in the dark you left behind<br>
          I seek the stars above the world to be the guides<br>
          But they all pale against the light in your eyes<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In your eyes<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          And I won't suppose to know why you walked away<br>
          But I can feel you pushing through beyond the space<br>
          To send your energy to me and I'll push through<br>
          Send your signal home and bring me back to you<br>
        </p>

        <h2>The Migration of Darkness</h2>
        <h3 class="attribution">by Peter Payack</h3>
        <p>
          Each evening, shortly after sunset,<br>
          darkness covers the land.<br>
          Having mystified thinkers for millennia,<br>
          the mechanism for this occurrence<br>
          has now been identified: migration.<br>
          Darkness, it has been found, is composed<br>
          of an almost infinite number of particles,<br>
          which roost and reproduce up north<br>
          where they have fewer natural enemies:<br>
          Forest fires, lampposts, lasers, blazing sunlight,<br>
          torches, candles, lighthouses, limelight, and electricity<br>
          are relatively rare in the polar regions.<br>

        <h2>Water Song</h2>
        <h3 class="attribution">by Su Shi</h3>
        <p>
          How rare the moon, so round and clear!<br>
          With cup in hand, I ask of the blue sky<br>
          I do not know in the celestial sphere<br>
          What name this festive night goes by?<br>
          I want to fly home, riding the wind<br>
          But fear the ethereal cold up there<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Dancing to my shadow<br>
          I feel no longer the mortal tie<br>
          She rounds the vermilion tower<br>
          Stoops to silk-pad doors<br>
          Shines on those who sleepless lie<br>
          It should not have resentment<br>
          People have sorrows, joys, parting and reunions<br>
          But rare is perfect happiness--<br>
          The moon does wax, the moon does wane<br>
          Yet these problems have have been this way<br>
          Yet one hopes for longevity<br>
          a thousand miles apart<br>
          together witnessing the moon's beauty.<br>
